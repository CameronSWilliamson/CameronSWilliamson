DevOps Engineer for WebMD Health Services

## Fun things I've worked on

- RustGin: A rust HTTP server which I designed based on the Router in the [Gin Framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).
- MyPL: A statically typed interpretted programming language that runs on a VM similar to the JVM.
- Dotfiles: Extensive dotfiles for my Arch-Linux based computers
- Calc: A basic RPN calculator written in Golang

## What have I been up to recently?

- I recently spun up a Kubernetes cluster and configured an enterprise environment in Kubernetes.
- I've been doing a lot of research on NixOS to increase reproducability in development environments.
  - Question for the reader: What do you use to manage your secrets (private SSH keys, kubeconfig files, etc...) in NixOS? I personally use Ansible to deploy the necessary secrets to their respective machines.
